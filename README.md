# USERPRINT
USERPRINT is a scalable, zero-shot framework that personalizes large language models (LLMs) by generating persona vectors from dialogues. It evaluates model performance across different conditions (chat, persona, combined), improving semantic and lexical alignment, and provides insights into robust, transferable LLM adaptation.
